### Overall Suggestions for Time and Space Complexity

# 1. **For large datasets**:
#  - If your data grows large, consider switching to list comprehensions instead of `filter`, as list comprehensions tend to have slightly better performance.
#  - Example for City Filter:
#    ```python
# cityFilter = [item for item in data if item["city"] == "New York"]
#    ```
#  - This is a minor optimization but can make a difference with big datasets.

# 2. **Improving Space Complexity**:
#  - Since `filter` only creates an iterator and doesnâ€™t store a list in memory until `list()` is called, it's quite memory-efficient.
#  - If your filters are being used separately, this approach is already efficient. For chained filters, using generators can help in memory efficiency.
